# book-outlet-scraper
This app was built with a love of books, and an appreciation for discounts. Book Outlet doesn't offer any reviews on their website, so it can be difficult to find quality content on the website. This bridges that gap by compiling the books available on bookoutlet.ca, comparing them to Google Books reviews, and filtering out anything that isn't quality or wanted.

## How to Use
Download a copy of the app and run an npm install. Run the app with `node app.js` and follow the steps the terminal prompts. The output is a JSON file with the books and their related information.

## Important Note
Google Books has a limit of 10,000 requests per day with the API.
